Story:

In the south of Mexico, in Tinum, Yucatan, there exists a monumental site called “El Castillo”. Its a famous pyramid, located at the archaeological site of Chichén Itzá, and built by the Maya civilization between the 9th and 12th centuries. It was dedicated to the feathered serpent god Kukulcán, a central figure in Mayan mythology. The pyramid stands tall, including the temples at the top, and consists of nine terraces. In this pyramid, you can find animals like the Iguanas, which come in both black and green colors, and often blend in with the rocky landscape. Finally, you can find many people around the site, as millions of visitors from around the world come to see the pyramid and explore the ancient Mayan city of Chichén Itzá.

Joxanniel:

In this challenge, I was able to familiarize myself with the ProBuilder tool in Unity. I felt more comfortable dealing with editing faces, edges and vertices in ProBuilder. I also got a basic understanding of how you extrude inward and outward with the tool. I was also able to acquaint myself with assets in the Unity store, and I was impressed by the huge variety of different assets in the store. Even though a lot of these are costly, it is comforting to know that there are enough free asset packs to suffice for a nice and simple group project like this.
